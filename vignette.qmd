In this vignette, we will go over clustering methods, going in detail into the methodology and the process to give you the tools to perform clustering for machine learning applications. We will delve into K-means and heirarchical clustering, and we will talk about the reasons to use or not to use hierarchical clustering.

Objectives: Learn clustering methods, when and why to use them. Introduce hierarchical clustering and compare the benefits and downsides. Learn visualization methods such as dendograms.
