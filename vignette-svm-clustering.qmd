## Support Vector Machines

In case a student was interested in supervised learning we decided to add support vector machines clustering because it is efficient in this work. It works better for two-class problems even if it can work with multi-variate class problems which is something to be aware of.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
