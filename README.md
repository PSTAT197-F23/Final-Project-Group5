# Final-Project-Group5

Vignette on implementing clustering methods (k-means and hierarchical) using the well known iris data; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2023.

**Contributors:** Kaitlyn Lee, Sanaz Ebrahimi, Yoobin Won, Aron Ma, Dylan Fu

**Vignette abstract:** This vignette guides the reader through the application of two key clustering algorithms, K-Means and Hierarchical clustering, using the Iris dataset. The reader will gain hands-on experience with using builtin methods to cluster the data in R and visualizing the results. This notebook will equip the reader with practical skills to analyze and group data based on their inherent similarities.

**Repository contents:** In the root repository we have the `vignette.qmd` our primary vignette document that teaches the different clustering methods with step-by-step explanations (should read like a lab activity)

-   `data`: contains `iris.csv` and corresponding `codebook.txt`

-   `scripts`: contains a `drafts` folder and a `vignette-script.R` file

    -   `drafts`: contains draft scripts for the different clustering methods
    -   `vignette-script.R`: script compiling the code from the primary vignette document with line annotations

-   `images` contains .png files of plots and output used in primary vignette document
